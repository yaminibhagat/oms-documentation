1. Go to the Rule Pipeline Page.
2. Click on the Edit function
3. Adjust the sequence according to your requirements. Typically, this involves dragging and dropping rules to rearrange their order of execution.
4. After arranging the rules in the desired sequence, click on the save function to update rule sequence.

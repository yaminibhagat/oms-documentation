# Schedule Reports from the Dashboard or Chart Interface

A report can also be scheduled via a dashboard or via a chart.

## Via a Dashboard

- View a dashboard and, in the top right corner, select the ellipsis icon and then Manage email report > Set up an email report.

## Via a Chart

- View a chart and, in the top right corner, select the ellipsis icon and then Manage email report > Set up an email report.

## Configure the Scheduled Report

- **Report Name (required):** Enter a memorable name for the new report and, in the Description field, enter a brief description of the report.

### Scheduling a New Report

- After the word Every, select the frequency of the report. Options include:
  - Year
  - Month
  - Week
  - Day
  - Hour
  - Minute

  After you select one of the above, the scheduler will present options that are relevant to your choice.

### Define Message Content

- For dashboards, only Image (PNG) is supported so this is automatically selected. For charts, choose between:
  - Image (PNG) embedded in the email field to receive the chart as an image that is directly embedded within the email message body.
  - Formatted CSV attached in the email field to receive the chart's raw data as a comma-separated value file that is attached to the email.

Your schedule has now been created. To verify, select Settings → Alerts & Reports → `Reports`  tab.

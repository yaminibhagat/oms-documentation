# Creating Multiple Charts from a Dataset

When you create charts using SQL queries, Tathya lets you use the generated dataset to create new charts. (Dataset serves as the primary source of your data. It contains the information you want to visualize)

This way you can create multiple charts to represent the same dataset in different ways. This is especially beneficial when you want to represent different facets of the data or tailor visuals for specific user groups.

Navigate to the "Charts" section in Tathya.

**Choose the Saved Dataset**

When creating a new chart, you'll have the option to choose an existing dataset. Look for the option "Datasets" and select the dataset you saved earlier.

**Select the Chart Type**

Choose the chart type that best suits the insights you want to convey.

**Configure the New Chart**

Configure the new chart using the selected dataset. You can define metrics, dimensions, and customize the chart settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating charts directly from SQL queries, columns are pre-mapped based on the query's output. However, using the "Create Chart" option allows you to drag and drop individual columns so that you have fine-grained control over what data is visualized. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets where not all columns are relevant to every analysis.
{% endhint %}

**Save the New Chart**

Once satisfied with the new chart configuration, save it.

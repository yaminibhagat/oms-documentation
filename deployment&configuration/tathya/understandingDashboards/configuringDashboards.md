# Save Chart to an Existing Dashboard Or Create a New Dashboard

While in the process of saving a chart, you have the option to directly add it to a dashboard.

In the "Add to Dashboard" field, you can specify whether you want to add the chart to an existing dashboard or create a new one.

- If you would like to save the chart to an existing dashboard, then select the dashboard from the drop-down list.
- If your new chart does not align with the existing dashboards, go ahead and enter the dashboard name and create a new dashboard.
- Select Save or, to browse directly to the defined dashboard, select Save & Go To Dashboard.

The added chart becomes easily shareable. Options include downloading data or a PNG file, copying the chart link, or setting up regular email reports for automated sharing.

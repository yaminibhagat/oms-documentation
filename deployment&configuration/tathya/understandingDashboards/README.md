# Understanding Dashboards

Dashboards in Tathya are practical spaces where you can organize and interpret your data. They have the unique capability to tell a story by combining different types of charts to form a narrative.

If you're starting from scratch, you can craft a new dashboard with a set of charts to visualize your information. Alternatively, if you already have charts that tell a story, you can assemble them into a dashboard for a consolidated view.

**Prerequisites:**

Ensure that you have access to the necessary data sources and have individual slices (charts or visualizations) already created in Tathya.

## Configuration Options for Dashboards

- [ ] Save Chart to an Existing Dashboard Or Create a New Dashboard
- [ ] Add Charts to a New Dashboard
- [ ] Add Charts When Editing a Dashboard
- [ ] Creating a New Chart from an Empty Dashboard

Your created dashboards will be automatically set to "Draft" status. In this phase, your dashboard is saved but not yet visible to other users. Progress from the draft stage to a published state by clicking on the "Drafts" in the Tathya interface. By converting the dashboard to "Published" status, you enable other users to view and interact with it.

Begin the integration process by installing a custom application on your Shopify store. This tailored app serves as the bridge between Shopify and HotWax Commerce OMS, facilitating a secure and efficient connection. This step specifically requires developer intervention, to know how to install a custom app refer to this [documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps). 

**Following the installation of the custom app, the next step involves obtaining essential credentials to establish a connection:**

{% hint style="info" %}
To establish connections between multiple Shopify stores that share the same product catalog, it's essential to obtain unique Admin API access tokens and API secrets for each Shopify store you intend to connect to the Order Management System (OMS). This ensures secure and individualized communication between each Shopify store and the OMS, enabling seamless coordination and data exchange across the interconnected platforms.

1. **Admin API Access Token:**
   Acquire the Admin API access token from the installed app. This token serves as a key component for accessing and managing administrative functionalities through the API.

2. **API Secret:**
   Retrieve the API secret associated with the installed app. This secret is crucial for secure communication and authentication between the systems, ensuring a robust and protected connection.

These credentials play a pivotal role in building a secure and functional connection between your systems, facilitating seamless data exchange and interaction.

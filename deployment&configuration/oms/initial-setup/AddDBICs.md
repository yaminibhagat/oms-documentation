# Add DBIC

## Overview
DBIC, or `Doing Business in Countries` is a feature that requires the retrieval of a country list from the client. When a client utilizes multiple eCommerce instances to cater to different countries, it is crucial to include only the countries relevant to the specific instance. 

Please note that the countries added here will be accessible in all address forms across the application. To ensure a positive user experience, it is advised to avoid adding an excessive number of countries.

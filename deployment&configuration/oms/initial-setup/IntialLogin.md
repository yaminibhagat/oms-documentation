# Login for the first time

After the instance is online, you'll be prompted to login. All instances are deployed with a default user.
For security reasons the default user is not documented here.

{% hint style="danger" %}
    After subsequent users are created, this default user should be disabled.
{% endhint %}

Because it's your first time login, you'll be prompted to reset your password.

After setting up an instance, its a good idea to check that all menus in the Sidebar and EXIM screen have loaded in correctly.

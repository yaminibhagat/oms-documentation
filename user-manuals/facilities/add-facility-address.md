# Add Facility Address

To ensure accurate facility management and fulfillment, it is crucial for the admin user to add address and latitude & longitude information. This foundational data not only facilitates seamless integration with external systems but also plays a vital role in optimizing logistical processes within HotWax Commerce. If the user has skipped adding this information initially, it can be added by following these steps:

1. On the `Find Facilities` page, find the facility you want to add an address to and tap on it. This will open the `Facility details` page.
2. Click on the `Add` button in the Address card which will open a pop-up menu. Users can add Address Line, City, Country, State and Zip codes for the facility here. 
3. After filling in the required details, click on the `Save` icon to save the facility address.
4. Users have the option to edit the address by clicking the `Edit` button below the address. Remember to save the edits using the `save` icon to update the address.

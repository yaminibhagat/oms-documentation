# Manage Existing Facilities

After the creation of facilities, retailers need to utilise the `Facilities` app to manage facility information. This includes tasks such as renaming facilities, updating address, modifying fullfillment settings, or adding and managing external mappings.

### Search Facilities

Retailers may often seek a particular facility or specific type of facilities. The search facilities functionality will enable users to effortlessly find their desired facility by navigating to the `Find Facilities` page by clicking on the `Facilities` button on the homepage to manage the existing facilities. There are two ways to locate the facilities for which users need to manage the configurations:

1. While looking for a specific facility, user can search the facility by name from the `Search facilities` functionality on the top left of the page.
2. To narrow down the list of facilities and locate facilities manually, user can utilise `Product Store` and facility `Type` filters.
   For instance, if a retailer has multiple product stores, the dropdown menu in the product store filter will present all the product stores from where the user can select any specific product store to access the facilities associated with the particular product store.
   Similarly, if a user is seeking a specific type of facility, they can use the type filter to view all the facilities of any partcular type.

### Linking Facility with External Systems

Before configuring any settings, it's crucial to establish a connection between the facilities within HotWax Commerce and external systems like e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and third-party logistics systems. Each facility in HotWax Commerce manages inventory; and the Available To Promise (ATP) is also controlled by retailers through ERP integration, ensuring accurate fulfillment and inventory management across the system. Users can map the HotWax Commerce facilities with external systems using the following steps:

1. **Access Facility Details:** Users can click on the desired facility's name which will redirect them to the facility details page, providing a comprehensive overview of the chosen facility.
2. **External Mapping:** Scroll down to the `External Mappings` tab located at the bottom of the facility details page.
3. **Map Facility to an External System:** Click on the `Map Facility to an External System` button to initiate the mapping process.
4. **Choose External System:** In the menu that appears, choose the external system for which a mapping has to be created.
5. **Fill in Required details:**

      * _For Shopify:_ Choose the appropriate Shopify store from the dropdown menu and add the location ID of the facilities that can be obtained from the Shopify admin panel.
      * _For Custom Mapping:_ Users can create custom mapping by selecting `Custom` option from the menu, adding the `Mapping ID`, `Mapping Name` (external system for which mapping needs to be done) and the Mapping Value (1xternal ID of the facility).

6. **Save Mapping:** Once the required information is filled in, click on the `save` icon to save the configuration. This integration lays the groundwork for a cohesive connection between the facility in HotWax Commerce and facility in the external system, facilitating streamlined configuration and operational processes.
7. **Edit and Remove:** Users can further edit the external ID in case of any modification of the facility on the external system using the `Edit` button or remove any mapping by clicking on the `Remove` button.

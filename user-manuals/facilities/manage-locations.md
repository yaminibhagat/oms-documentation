# Manage Locations

Effective stock management relies on proficient location management. To enable store associates to establish precise locations for managing stock, which will ease in receiving and storing inventory, as well as facilitating the picking process, ​​retailers can define specific locations within facilities, such as Area, Aisle, Section, Level, or Sequence. Users can manage locations in the facility using the `Locations` tab in the footer on the `Facility details` page. 


**Add Location**

To add a new location within the facility, click on the `Internal Locations` button to open a location pop-up card.

Fill in the required information to add the location to the facility.

1. **Type:** The location is divided into four types.
    * _Bulk_ - This area stores large quantities of inventory not intended for immediate picking or display. This is a long-term storage space for excess stock, or bulk materials.
    * _Pick/Primary_ - This is where the most frequently accessed items are stored. It's designed for efficient order fulfillment, with easy access for pickers, and quick movement of goods.
    * _Receiving Bay_ - This is the designated area for incoming deliveries. It allows for unloading, inspection, and initial processing of new inventory before it's moved to its designated storage location.
    * _Staging_ - This area acts as a temporary holding space for goods in various stages of processing. It could be used for preparing orders for shipment, kitting products or holding returns before processing.
2. **Area:** A designated section within a warehouse or a store with a specific function, department, or purpose.
3. **Aisle:** This is a designated walkway between sections within the warehouse or retail store. Aisles are numbered or named for easy navigation and identification.
4. **Section:** This further subdivides an area and usually refers to a specific range of product categories or brands.
5. **Level:** This defines the vertical plane of the location, especially in multi-story warehouses. For a single-story building, 'level' might not be used.
6. **Sequence:** This term is closely related to picking and usually refers to a specific order in which items need to be picked to optimize efficiency. It could be based on product location, order size, or customer priority.

Finally, Click on the `save` icon to save the location within the facility.

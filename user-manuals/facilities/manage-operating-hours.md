# Manage Operating Hours

It is crucial to display the operating hours of each store on the e-commerce Product Display Page (PDP) to enhance customer experience, especially for Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS) orders. Failing to showcase this information may result in customers arriving to collect their orders beyond operating hours, leading to disappointment and potentially increasing the order cancellation rate. Additionally, providing operating hours is vital for communicating with shipping carriers about the store's timings. Operating hours of any facility can be managed on the `Facility details` page in the following ways:  

1.  Users can select the operating hours by clicking on any of the pre-existing calendars in the `Operating hours` card. Once the calendar is selected they can click on the `Add Operating Hours` button.
2.  Users can also create a custom schedule for the store using the following steps:

    a. Click on the `Custom Schedule` button on the `Operating hours` card.
    
    b. A pop-up menu will appear, prompting users to add a schedule name, start time, and end time. Click on the `save` icon to save standard operating hours for the entire week.
    
    c. To establish different start and end times for specific days, toggle on the `Daily Timings` option. Select the start and end time for each day of the week. If no time is specified for a particular day, it will be considered closed for that day (e.g. Saturday and Sunday).
    
    d. Click the `save` icon to confirm and save the customized operating hours.

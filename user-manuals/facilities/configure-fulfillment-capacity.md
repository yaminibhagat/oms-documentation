# Configure Fulfillment Capacity

Fulfillment capacity is defined on the basis of the number of orders a facility will be able to fulfill in a day. It is set up considering various resources such as facility size, staff, and footfall. Users can set up the maximum order limit that can be allocated to that facility through the `Online Order Fulfillment` card. Users can manage the order fulfillment capacity of the facility using the following steps:


1. On the `Online Order Fulfillment` card, next to `number of orders allocated today`, there is a button that, when tapped, opens an overflow menu. This menu can be used to set up the fulfillment capacity of the facility. The following options are available on the `Fulfillment Capacity` overflow menu:

    * **Unlimited capacity:** Removes the fulfillment capacity limit, allowing the facility to handle an   unrestricted number of orders. This setting is not recommended for retail stores.
    * **No capacity:** Sets the fulfillment capacity to 0, preventing any new orders from being brokered to the   facility. The capacity should be only set to 0 if the facility is unavailable to fulfill any upcoming orders. This setting should be used cautiously.
    * **Custom:** Allows the users to set a custom number for the order fulfillment capacity.

2. Click on `Apply` to save the chosen capacity. The users can also view the consumed capacity, out of the added fulfillment capacity on the card. 



Users can also see the facility order count history by clicking on the `View order count history` button on the `Online Order Fulfillment` card. This will help them in setting up the capacity based on their previous records.



Furthermore, the `Find Facilities` page also offers the ability to view consumed capacity and configure fulfillment capacity seamlessly.

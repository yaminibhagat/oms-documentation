# Manage Product Stores

Users managing multiple product stores in HotWax Commerce can associate the facility with specific product store on the `Facility details` page. For facilities selling products from multiple product stores, users can also specify the `Primary` product store associated with the facility. Users can add the product store to a facility using the following steps:

1. Click on the `Add` button within the `Product Stores` card to initiate the process of adding a new product store.
2. A pop-up menu will appear, presenting a list of available product stores. Choose the relevant product store(s) that you want to associate with the selected facility.
3. After selecting the product store(s), click on the save icon to add them to the facility. The names of the selected product store(s) will now appear within the product store card.
4. Users have the option to designate a specific product store as the `Primary` store or `Unlink` a product store from the facility in the selected product store's overflow menu.

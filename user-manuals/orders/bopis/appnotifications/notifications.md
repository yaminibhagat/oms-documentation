# Notifications

Upon the arrival of a new order at the store, timely notification is crucial for store associates. BOPIS notifications deliver updates on both new and open orders within a facility, significantly improving the ease of handling order preparation and handover procedures.\
\
Store managers can customise their notification preferences for the following topics:

* **New Orders:** Receive prompt notifications as new orders become available for preparation at the facility.
* **Open Orders Reminder:** Receive periodic reminders for open orders at the facility, helping users stay organised.
* **Ready for Pickup Orders Reminder:** Receive reminders for orders ready for pickup at the facility, ensuring timely customer communication.

The frequency of reminder notifications can be configured through the Open BOPIS Order Notifications job in the Job Manager app's Fulfillment category.\
\
To manage notification frequency, go to the HotWax Commerce launchpad and access the job manager app. Access the fulfillment page from the left menu. Click on the Open BOPIS order notification button on the Notification card. A extended menu will appear on the right. Select the run time and schedule according to the preference and save to regulate the reminder frequency of the notifications.&#x20;

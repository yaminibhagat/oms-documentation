# Packed Order Tab

Orders that are packed and ready to handover to the customer appear on the packed order tab. An email is triggered to the customer that their order is ready for pickup and in case the customer overlooks the email and doesn't come to pick up their order, store associates can re-send email notification to the customer addressing the challenge of delayed pick-ups, misunderstandings, and even order cancellations.&#x20;

1. **Packing Slip**

A packing slip is a document listing the contents of a shipped package. It serves as a quick reference for both the sender and the recipient to verify the accuracy of the delivered goods.

With the generate packing slip feature, store associates can generate packing slips manually from the Packed Tab using the print icon, available on each order.

{% hint style="info" %}
For packing slip (document) generation, the app opens a new tab. Ensure that the Pop-Up blocker is disabled to allow seamless access.
{% endhint %}

2. **Handover Order**

When the customer arrives to receive the order, the store associate will handover the order to the customer and will mark the order delivered by clicking on the Handover button.

Store associates can also access the handover functionality from the order details page of the packed order.

{% hint style="info" %}
After clicking the handover button, the orders are marked complete and moved to Completed Orders Tab.
{% endhint %}

3. **Resend Email Notifications**

Store associates can promptly remind customers to pick-up their orders by re-sending the ready-for-pickup notification from the Packed Orders tab by clicking on the mail icon, a pop up menu will appear confirming re-sending the email. Click on the send button to resend pickup email to the customer.&#x20;

Store associates can also access the resend customer email functionality from the order details page of the packed order.

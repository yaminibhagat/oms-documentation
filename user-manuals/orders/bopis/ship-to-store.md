# Ship to Store

The `Ship to Store` feature helps customers in placing pickup orders for products that are not immediately available for same-day fulfillment at their preferred location. Users of the BOPIS app can find the `Shipping to store` page by clicking on the `trail` icon on the top right corner of the `Orders` page.  

Shopify retailers can install the HotWax Commerce BOPIS PDP App within their Shopify stores enabling their customers to select a specific future timeframe for their pickup. Customers will see an estimated pickup timeframe directly on the product detail page, displayed as "Pick up in x days‚Äù.  

Once the order is downloaded, HotWax Commerce categorizes it as a "Ship to Store" order and brokers it to a facility from where the inventory will be shipped to the pickup location. After a fulfillment location has been designated, store employees can use the following steps to monitor and fulfill `Ship to Store` orders:  

1. Click on the `trail` icon on the top right corner of the `Orders` page, this will redirect the user to the `Shipping to store` page.  
2. Users can use the `Search` bar on the top left of the page to find orders using customer name or order ID.  
  
The **Shipping to store** page is segmented into three tabs:

   * _**Incoming:**_ This tab displays the incoming inventory that has been received. Store staff can label an order `Arrived` upon receiving it. A notification will then be sent to the customer, informing them that their order is now available for pickup.  
   * _**Ready for Pickup:**_ This tab displays the orders that are ready for pickup. Once the customer arrives at the store for pickup and receives the order, the store associate marks `Handover`, moving the order to the completed orders tab.  
   * _**Completed:**_ This tab displays all the completed BOPIS ship to store orders handed over to the customers in the past 24 hours.

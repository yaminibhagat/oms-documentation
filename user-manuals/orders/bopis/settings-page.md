# Settings 

Settings for the BOPIS app can be accessed by clicking on the `Settings` button on the bottom tab of the app. It displays a list of all the settings that can be configured to streamline processes and optimize BOPIS efficiency. 
***

#### Facility
Users can use this setting to select the facility they want to operate from. Orders, inventory and other configuration data will be specific to the facility that the users select. 

#### Order Edit Permissions
If an order is rejected by the store, the customer receives an email notifying them of the rejection and outlining the alternate fulfillment options that are available. Users can use toggle buttons to conveniently enable or disable permissions for various aspects of the orders that customers are allowed to edit when updating their orders on Re-route Fulfillment. 
   * **Delivery Method:** Enable or disable the permission for customers to edit the delivery method for their orders. 
   * **Delivery Address:** Enable or disable the permission for customers to edit the delivery address for their orders. 
   * **Pickup Location:** Enable or disable the permission for customers to edit the pickup location for their orders. 
   * **Cancel Order Before Fulfillment:** Enable or disable the permission for customers to cancel their order before itâ€™s fulfilled. 
   * **Shipment Method:** Allow the customers to edit the shipment method for their orders using a dropdown menu with available options. 
 
#### Partial Order Rejection
Store managers can use this setting to control whether a BOPIS order can be partially rejected in case there is insufficient inventory of specific items at the store.

#### Product Identifier
Users can choose primary and secondary product identifiers (such as product ID, product title, SKU, etc.) to view products with preferred identifiers in the app. 

#### Timezone
This option allows users to select an appropriate timezone to ensure consistency and optimize operations according to local time. 

#### Language
This option allows users to select a preferred display language for the app.

#### Shipping Orders
For stores managing both `BOPIS` and `Ship from Store` orders, switching between apps can be challenging. To optimize this process, the `Show Shipping Orders` feature can be enabled. This will allow users to view and fulfill regular orders brokered to their store by the OMS directly within the BOPIS app. Users can easily control this setting using the toggle button to enable or disable it as needed.

#### Packing Slip
Packing slips help customers reconcile their orders against the delivered items. Store managers can use the Generate Packing Slip toggle to control whether or not packing slips are generated for orders.

#### Track Pickers
Store managers can assign store pickup orders to store associates and track associates who picked orders, by entering their picker IDs when packing an order. They can use the `Track Pickers` toggle to enable tracking. This is essential to manage picker commission.

#### Notification Preferences
Users can select the notifications they want to receive in the BOPIS app.
   * **New order notification:** Enable or disable notifications for any new orders. 
   * **Open order notification:** Enable or disable notifications for pending open orders. 
   * **Ready for pickup order notification:** Enable or disable notifications for orders that are ready to be picked up by customers.

# View Order Item Rejection History

If an item of the order is rejected, order item rejection history can be viewed by clicking on the clock icon at the top right of the order details page.\
\
If an order with one item is rejected, it will disappear from the BOPIS app and the rejected item status will be displayed in the Sales Order page of the OMS. And when the item is rebrokered, the item rejection history will be viewed by accessing the clock icon at the top right corner of the order details page.

**Reject Orders**

During peak hours or promotional events, brick-and-mortar retail locations often face increased in-store traffic, heightening the risk that the requested item for pick-up may become unavailable due to in-store purchases. In such instances, store associates may need to reject the order or reject partial order in case the order item inventory is insufficient at the store. This feature can be enabled using the toggle on the settings page.

To reject an order, access the open order page. Select the order card to navigate to the order details page. Choose reasons for rejection. Click on the 'Report an Issue' button to access a pop-up menu bar for selecting rejection reasons. Confirm the rejection by clicking on the save icon.

Upon rejecting an item, customers will receive an email with alternate fulfillment options, and the rejected order item will be promptly removed from your dashboard.
{% endhint %}

The reasons for rejection are as followed:

**a. Not in Stock**

Items are out of stock or exhausted at the store. When the store associate selects Not In Stock as a reason for rejection, the Inventory ATP (Available to Promise) and QOH (Quantity on Hand) are set to 0 for that product for the selected store.\
All open orders with respective items are auto-rejected from the store.\

**b. No Reason**

There is no specific reason for rejection.  When the store associate selects Not Reason as a reason for rejection, the inventory ATP is increased by the same quantity and QOH is increased by the same quantity.

In omnichannel retail, "Safety Stock" is a key strategy for managing inventory effectively. Unlike traditional practices, it prevents committing all stock to online orders. Instead, when a store's inventory drops below a set threshold, the remaining stock is reserved exclusively for in-store sales.

Omnichannel retailers often face inventory discrepancies, where system records don't match actual stock. Safety stock helps mitigate the risk of accepting orders that can't be fulfilled due to these discrepancies.

This manual guides users in setting up safety stock for optimal inventory control.

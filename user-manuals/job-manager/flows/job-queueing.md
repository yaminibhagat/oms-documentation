Scheduled job parameters can be modified directly from the Job Pipeline page, enabling users to tailor job execution to specific needs. This flexibility allows for optimization of job performance and resource utilization.

**Detailed Job History for Analysis and Troubleshooting**

Comprehensive historical job data is readily accessible for analysis and troubleshooting purposes. Users can identify patterns, optimize job performance, and resolve recurring issues by examining historical job execution details.

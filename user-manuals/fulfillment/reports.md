### Daily Warehouse Fulfillment Report

In the era of eCommerce growth, retail warehousing has become increasingly crucial to modern businesses. A fully functional warehouse gives the best output because of its low inventory carrying cost. As a result, the warehouse is responsible for fulfilling the majority of orders placed. 

As warehouse operations are incredibly massive, there is always a possibility that some brokered orders can get misplaced or left unattended during the process. For merchants, evaluating warehouse performance and order fulfillment rates becomes crucial to success.

The **Daily Warehouse Fulfillment Report** provides all the orders brokered at the warehouse but not fulfilled yet. The report shows all the daily shipped and pending orders at a warehouse. 

After identifying all the pending orders within this report, retailers can work to clear the backlog. Ultimately, this report helps to analyze the warehouse's fill rate. And in the case of multiple warehouses, it helps to compare their performance and give retailers actionable insights to improve their omnichannel order fulfillment strategy.

### Daily Store Shipment Performance Report

Merchants measure their stores’ omnichannel order fulfillment rates and want a clear, accurate view of their daily shipping performance. Therefore, merchants seek a detailed storewide report that displays every store’s daily shipping performance.

The **Daily Store Shipment Performance Report** shows the number of daily shipped orders for each store, giving an overview of the store’s daily performance.  

This performance report also yields valuable insight into the most active and least active stores within a set timeframe. With this data, retailers can work with underperforming stores to understand the reason for low activity, identify the cause of under performance, and resolve the issue.

Similarly, the retailer wants to see product-level shipping performance. The report also includes product-level performance. This information helps retailers understand a newly launched product's performance in a given area or region. Retailers can plan their inventory accordingly after knowing which products perform best at a given store.

### Store Dashboard
Omnichannel retailers use stores as their order fulfillment locations. Fulfillment centers help merchants meet customer expectations of faster delivery. Merchants often operate multiple stores in various locations within their operational area so they need a reliable way to measure their fulfillment performance.

Many reasons contribute to stores delaying and rejecting orders, including low operational strength and inventory shortages. Customer order cancellations are also common. Tracking store fulfillment performance enables retailers to identify and resolve these order fulfillment issues.

Likewise, merchants prefer to keep a company-wide order fulfillment goal for daily processed, shipped, rejected, and canceled orders. Any facility performing below the set goal raises a concern for merchants and puts their focus on improving performance of these facilities.  

The **Store Dashboard** shows the storewide data where the orders were brokered, rejected, canceled, and then fulfilled in a day. 

The report shows the percentage of shipped, processed, and canceled orders of the stores. Retailers can compare the actual fulfillment performance against the set goal to assess performance of each store.

### Daily BOPIS Orders

Insider reports that 39% of consumers prefer using BOPIS when placing online orders because they get their orders faster. During their BOPIS journey, customers also expect prompt notifications from the brand on the status of their orders. 

When customers can’t come to the store to pick up their orders, store managers need a detailed report on the unpicked BOPIS orders.  

The **Daily BOPIS Orders Report** provides cumulative details of all the BOPIS orders of the last 30 days. This Shopify report also shows the status of these BOPIS orders if orders are picked up, canceled, or not picked up. 

With this detailed report, store managers also look for long pending BOPIS orders. These orders keep the inventory blocked which can be used to fulfill other orders. With the knowledge of pending BOPIS orders, merchants can cancel all long-pending orders and use the inventory for new orders. 

The report is essential to improve the BOPIS order fulfillment rate. Again, the fewer the unpicked orders, the better the order fill rate. Additionally, the problem diagnosis with the report helps retailers to clear the challenges in the omnichannel order fulfillment cycle.

### Shipment Tracking Report

Merchants use third-party services to ship orders to customers' addresses. Orders are picked, packed, and handed to third-party logistics (3PL) companies like FedEx and UPS. All shipments dispatched have their unique tracking ID. This tracking ID is provided by the 3PLs and helps customers keep track of their orders. 

Because multiple shipments are sent out daily, merchants require a centralized view of order shipment details. This Shopify report helps merchants quickly identify an order's tracking ID, shipping address, and dispatch location.

The **Shipment Tracking Report** shows the daily shipment details for each order. Using this report, merchants can quickly resolve questions related to order tracking by finding the tracking ID and the shipping address for the order.

## Problematic Orders

These reports help retailers find where orders are falling through the cracks and ensure that all orders are beign shipped out on time.

### Daily Unfulfilled Expedited Orders
According to the State of Shipping Report, 62% of consumers expect their orders to arrive in less than three business days. To help expedite shipping, many brands have started implementing same-day/next-day delivery. That sounds like an easy fix, right?

Well, sometimes omnichannel order fulfillment teams can't fulfill same-day/next-day orders due to inventory discrepancies or other reasons. Orders go unfulfilled, which leads to increased order cancellations, poor customer service, and broken promises.

To provide a better customer experience, merchants have dedicated Customer Success Teams. The Customer Success Team wants to be on top of unfulfilled expedited delivery orders and continuously work on decreasing the order cancellation rate.

To effectively manage unfulfilled expedited orders, Customer Success Teams need a **Daily Unfulfilled Expedited Orders Report**. This report provides a granular view of all the unfulfilled same-day/next-day delivery orders. It also helps identify the order’s last brokered location with brokering time.

Furthermore, the report will help Customer Success Teams to evaluate the efficiency of their expedited shipping fulfillment process. Due to the large volume of expedited orders handled by an OMS daily, merchants prefer to have a daily report of all unfulfilled orders.

### Daily Unfulfilled Orders
Merchants set benchmarks for fulfilling orders. Generally, merchants intend to complete order fulfillment within a seven-day maximum time frame. If any order’s fulfillment takes more than seven days, it draws a merchant’s attention.

To avoid order delays, merchants prefer to check all the pending orders at the facilities and alert fulfillment locations to speed up order fulfillment.

The **Daily Unfulfilled Orders Report** provides the data for all unfulfilled orders at different fulfillment locations. These can be standard, same-day/next-day delivery or store pick-up orders. The report also shows the last brokered facility and order brokered time which helps retailers analyze unfulfilled orders and mitigate challenges in the omnichannel order fulfillment pipeline.
